Consider waiting for currently processing files before queries on these files
Consider changing offsets in currently modified files the same way compilation mode does
Use the same pch file for rc/rdm/shared
Maybe clang has some gcc compat mode where it would work approriately with the
   headers from the toolchain
Solve constructors and destructors for rename symbol.
When a file has disappared it never gets out of the database
cache compile errors from clang and do something like what we do we fixits
do eventsource from rdm to emacs
we break on dos line endings. We could solve this by using
   line/col when emacs has converted the line endings. rc needs to
   understand lines columns

### Bug. -E doesn't give definitions and declarations. At least not for target in CursorInfo.
